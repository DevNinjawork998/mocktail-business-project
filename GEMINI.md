# Client Expectation

A few as that needs to be fulfill.

Cilents ask:

- create running banner on the front page for latest messages & photos for the landing section we greet out customers. 
- The expectation of the running banner is to flash out images for recent activities. So you want to consider the sizing for this running banner.
- Drop Benefits page and add our community page to flash out some community photos.
